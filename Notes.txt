Dart :
 
Data type :- It defines size and type of the data.

Types :-  
1. int (for no s.)
2. double (for floating point no.)
3. string (for alpha numeric value) (Are always represent in " " .)
4. bool (for boolen type values - True / False)
5. list (for large amount of data like array)
6. map (for data in key and value format)

Comments :- single (//)
                     multi line (/*...............*/)

Operators :-  Operators are used to performs operations b/w two or more operands
In dart 6 types of operators:
1. Arithmetic operator : Are used to perform arithmetic operations b/w two or more operands.
2. Relation operator : Are used to check the relation (condition) b/w two or more operands.
                                Are always return the boolean type result.(True / False)
3. Logical operator
4. Assignment operator
5. Conditional operator
6. Typeof / Type text operator : as , is and is!

Loops :-  for(initialization;condition;updation)
               {
                      Statement.
               }
              for(int i=1;i<=3;i++)
              {
               print(i);
              }  

User input : First import dart standard input output library(import 'dart:io';)

Function :- Fnx is a way to achieve any task in dart programming language. 
                 Syntax - return_type name_of_fn(arguments if any)
                              {

                               } 

OOPs :- It is  just a concept.
Features: 
1. Class: It is just a template , in other word class is a collections of variables , methods(functions) and constructors.
2. Object: It is a real world entity.
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation

Constructor :- It is a special type of member funciton.
It's name same as it's class name.
It's have no any return type.
You cannot call the constructor manually it will we call automatically at a time object creation.
Types :-
1. Default constructor
2. Named constructor 
   syntax: class_name.any_name()
               {

               }	
3. Parameterized constructor

Inheritance :- Is a way to resuse any code inside another code.
Types:
1. Single level Inh.
2. Multi level Inh.
3. Hierarchical Inh.
4. Multiple Inh.(not supported by dart)
5. Hybrid Inh.(not supported by dart)
Note: If you want inherit any code inside another code so you must be used 'extends' keyword.

Assignment_1 :- Print the table of 2.

Assignment_2 :- Num is even or odd?

Assignment_3 :- Value is  capital , small , number or symbol?

Assignment_4 :- WAP to get input child age and if age is from 1 to 5, so print "go to counter number 1 for polio drop" 
and if age is 5 and less than 10, so print "go to counter no.2 for vaccination"
and if age greater than 10 and less than 15, so output is "go to counter no.3 for vitamins and minerals" 
and if age is greater than 15 then output is "invalid".

Assignment_5 :- WAP to write a story till the user cannot type 'stop' . if user type 'stop' then program will end.
